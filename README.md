# Robotics
Some codes that I maked on the class of Robotics that are useful for get positions, translations, velocities and acelerations of systems. All are on MATLAB. 
There you can find 
- Acelerations
- Denavit Hartenberg 
- Inverse cinematics
- Matrix used for robotics design
- Jacobian methods
Some are codes where you only need to change the values of the first matrix and the rest is done automatically.
